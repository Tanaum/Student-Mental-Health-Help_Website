# Description 
Students around the globe face a lot of due to many reasons. Thus, I created a website which offers awesome tools for students to use!

# Features
1. All important stress management advice for students in one place.
2. Checklist for them to make sure they are following majority of the advice (if not all of it).
3. A place for them to journal easily!
4. Something somewhat basic: a button to toggle between dark and light modes.

# Tech stack
As a beginner web developer, I used the following languages to make my website:
+ HTML

# What's in store for this project's future?
- Indefinitely store the journal entries onto the users computer.
- Have a system for accounts so users can access their journal entries remotely.
- Checkboxes stay checked off for an entire day

# Fun (?) facts
- This project was actually made for a hackthon (Empower Hacks 2.0).
- I did majority of the development on my smartphone using Replit (not sponsored :p (yet)).
- I am thinking of making the journal a separate project of its own.
